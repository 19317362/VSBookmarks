VSBookmarks is a numeric bookmarks extension for Visual Studio.
===============================================================
Provides up to nine enumerated bookmarks for every text editor tab. All the bookmarks are accessible by shortcuts or via a context menu (see for VSBookmarks submenu).

Use Ctrl-shift-[1..9] to set, change or remove a bookmark (you will see an appropriate digit on the left margin of the editor area).
Shortcuts Ctrl-[1..9] are used to go to a previously set bookmark.
===============================================================
Please note, Visual Studio blocks reassigning shortcuts automatically. It means you have to assign some of shortcuts by hand using Tools -> Customize. Click “Keyboard…” and type in a filter “VSBookmarks” (without quotes) and assign shortcuts for commands is the list below.

Nowadays VSNumeric supports Visual Studio 2013 only.
===============================================================
TODOs:
1) Bookmark columns (not just rows)
2) Add dark theme support
3) Exclude some constants to a separate file
4) Build for Visual Studio 2012 (and 2010?)
