#VSBookmarks

**VSBookmarks is a numeric bookmarks extension for Visual Studio.**

<img style="float: left; margin-right: 20px" src="https://raw.github.com/SergeyVinyar/VSBookmarks/master/README_img/screenshot.png">

Provides up to nine enumerated bookmarks for every text editor tab. All of them are accessible by shortcuts:

* **Ctrl-Shift-[1..9]** - set, change or remove a bookmark (you will see an appropriate digit on the left margin of the editor area);
* **Ctrl-[1..9]** - go to a previously set bookmark.

If some of these shortcuts don't work you need to free them via Tools -> Customize -> <Keyboard...> button.
In most cases no additional actions are required.

##Todo's
* Bookmark columns (not just rows)
* Build for Visual Studio 2012 (and 2010?)
